Portfolio Assignment
When developing my mood board I thought about things I like, such as my favourite animal and bird, Giraffe and Pelican.  I like them for their features that show their uniqueness. What brings me balance in life, time in nature, doing meditation and yoga.  Also time spent with family friends.  Creating trusted, meaningful and valued relationships built on integrity.  How did I create this in page.  Too much!

So then I thought about how I admire the inner calmness of Japanese people appear to embody.  This lead me to think about my drawing I did on my iPad of Sakura or Cherry Blossoms.  They embody these qualities in my mind. So that was my answer.

When coming up with my design,  I wanted to create a different look and feel to each screen size while still using my drawing.  

Challenges: How to I create this within my SCSS?  Could I achieve this?  Also in my design was a hamburger menu for mobile and a top nav for desktop and iPad.
